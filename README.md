Useful-Rust-Project
====================

List of community wanted important libraries.

This repo is meant to be used as a list of the community wanted libraries, whether they are already
started and need more hands to be improved / maintained, or if they have to be started from scratch.
Working on having libraries to support the language is at least as important as the language itself and
is a great way to get more familiar with the language.

The point is also to have a place for coders looking to contribute to Rust to find what is really needed.

(it's shamelessly inspired / copied from @brson [rust links](http://brson.github.io/rustlinks.html), the reason
is mainly to have a community repository that evolves with time instead of a static page)

Feel free to add new projects / libraries via pull requests.

TODO from scratch
---------------------
Note : this is hamelessly inspired/copied from @brson again ([source](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2014-June/010139.html))

# Either a port or a binding of [Reactivex*](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
significance : functionnal reactive programming is a programming paradigm with increasing popularity.
# [Internationalization](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/14494)
ECMA 402 is a standard for internationalization, dealing with the 
automatic conversion of various information based on locale. Rust's core 
libraries provide *no* internationalization. A core problem here will be 
determining how Rust should think about locales.
# [Localization](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/14495)
This may depend on the previous for locale support, if nothing else. 
This is largely about the human-assisted translation of strings. We 
would like to experiment with a new Moco-developed standard for this, 
called L20N. This project will be about figuring out how the L20N API 
can be adapted to Rust.
# [Unicode (ICU)](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/14656)
The exact path forward here may require a bit of discussion still, but I 
think the most viable approach starts with binding libicu and wrapping 
in a Rust API.
# [Date/Time](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/14657)
Our time crate is very minimal, and the API looks dated. This is a hard 
problem and JodaTime seems to be well regarded so let's just copy it.
# [Crypto](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/14655)

We've previously made the decision not to distribute any crypto with 
Rust at all, but this is probably not tenable since crypto is used 
everywhere. My current opinion is that we should not distribute any 
crypto /written in Rust/, but that distributing bindings to proven 
crypto is fine.

Figure out a strategy here, build consensus, then start implementing a 
robust crypto library out of tree, with the goal of merging into the 
main distribution someday, and possibly - far in the future - 
reimplementing in Rust. There are some existing efforts along these 
lines that should be evaluated for this purpose.

There are a lot of people interested in, and working on, this subject, 
and crypto potentially interacts with many libraries (like HTTP) so 
coordination is needed.
# [SQL](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/14658)
Generic SQL bindings. I'm told SqlAlchemy core is a good system to learn 
from.
